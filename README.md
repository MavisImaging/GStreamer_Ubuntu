## 1. Install the Camera

Ensure that your camera is properly installed and connected to your Ubuntu machine.

## 2. Set the IP Address of Your Machine

Configure the IP address of your machine.

## 3. Install GStreamer

GStreamer might not be pre-installed on all versions of Ubuntu, but it is available in the official Ubuntu repositories. To install GStreamer and its plugins, use the following commands:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gstreamer1.0-tools gstreamer1.0-plugins-base gstreamer1.0-plugins-good gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly gstreamer1.0-libav libgstreamer1.0-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev
```
## 4. Run Python Code
Download the stream_camera.py file to your Ubuntu machine and run it in the same folder using:
```
python3 stream_camera.py
```
Alternatively, you can directly paste this command into your terminal:
```
gst-launch-1.0 mvsrc ! videoconvert ! autovideosink
```

## 5. Debugging
If you encounter the error: **"no element 'mvsrc'"**:

## Copy the Plugin to the GStreamer Directory:
If the *libgstmvsrc.so* file is not present in the *gstreamer-1.0* folder, you can download it from this repository. 
After downloading, paste the file on your desktop. Replace *USER* with your computer's username in the following command:
```
sudo cp ~/home/USER/libgstmvsrc.so /usr/lib/gstreamer-1.0/
```
## Verify Plugin Registration:
```
gst-inspect-1.0 mvsrc
```
## Check File Permissions:
```
ls -l /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gstreamer-1.0/libgstmvsrc.so
```
Ensure that the file has read and execute permissions for the user running gst-inspect-1.0. You may need superuser (root) privileges to change permissions if necessary:
```
sudo chmod +r /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gstreamer-1.0/libgstmvsrc.so
```
## Check GStreamer Plugin Cache:
Sometimes, GStreamer may not have updated its plugin cache to recognize newly installed plugins. Try rebuilding the plugin cache explicitly:
```
rm ~/.cache/gstreamer-1.0/registry.x86_64.bin
gst-inspect-1.0 --gst-plugin-path=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gstreamer-1.0/
```
